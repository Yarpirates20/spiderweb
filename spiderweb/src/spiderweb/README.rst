spiderweb: Web app attack tree
==================================================================

#TODO: Modify the whole file as necessary.
#TODO: Add command line option to store flag format (beginning, end, etc.).
#TODO: Create a Guided UI class that will guide the user through basic steps of attacking web apps. 


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install most Python packages is via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

    $ easy_install spiderweb

Usage
-----

TODO: This is a good place to start with a couple of concrete examples of how the package should be used.

The boilerplate code provides a dummy ``main`` function that prints out the word 'Hello'::

    >> from spiderweb import main
    >> main()
    
When the package is installed via ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` this function will be bound to the ``spiderweb`` executable in the Python installation's ``bin`` directory (on Windows - the ``Scripts`` directory).
